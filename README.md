# Forecast Zoho CRM deals with AlphaVantage market data, GPT‑4 and Slack alerts

This workflow automatically fetches active deals from Zoho CRM, retrieves real-time market signals, calculates AI-enhanced forecast metrics, evaluates deal-market alignment, stores data in a database, updates CRM, and sends a summary alert to Slack.

This workflow runs weekly to help sales teams make data-driven decisions. It fetches all open deals from Zoho, calculates expected revenue using deal amount, probability, seasonal trends, and market signals. An AI node evaluates each deal’s match ratio against current market conditions. Forecasts and AI insights are stored in a database and written back into Zoho. A Slack message summarizes the key metrics for easy review.

You receive:

* **Weekly automated deal forecast**.
* **AI-powered deal-market alignment insights**.
* **Database storage for historical trends**.
* **Slack summary notifications**.

Ideal for sales teams wanting real-time insights into pipeline health and market alignment without manual calculations.

2. Add your **Zoho CRM credentials** in all relevant nodes.
3. Add your **AlphaVantage API key** in the Market Signal node.
4. Connect your **Slack** credentials and select the channel for alerts.
5. Connect your **Supabase** (or preferred database) account for storing forecasts.
